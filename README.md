# 8kyu

This branch contains my solutions for 8kyu challenges on Codewars. The focus is on beginner-level problems, allowing me to strengthen foundational programming skills like basic loops, conditionals, and simple data structures.

# Languages used:
- Javascript

# Technologies used:

- Jest for unit testing.
- Husky for pre-commit hooks to ensure tests are passing before code is committed.
- ESLint to maintain clean and consistent code structure.

Feel free to explore the solutions, try the challenges, and check out the tests to see how the solutions are verified!
