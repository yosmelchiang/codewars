A prime number is a positive number greater than 1 that has exactly two unique positive divisors: 1 and itself.

A prime cannot be divided evenly by any other whole numbers except 1 and itself.

Examples:

2 - `2 / 1 = 2` and `2 / 2 = 1` thus = prime

Not prime:

1 is not a prime number because it only has one divisor, itself.

4 is not a prime number, because it has more than two divisors (it can be divided by 2)

6 is not a prime number, it has more than two divisors (it can be divided by 2 and 3)
